This program was assigned my junior year of high school.
The attatched files contain the code I submitted for this program.

**Instructions:**
- Create a working poker game where a user can play against a computer.
- Have the computer always make the most optimal moves.
- Practice OOP concepts by using seperate classes for the game (Main), player, deck, and card.
- Use an enum for the card suits.
- Use a stack data structure for the card deck.

**Key Take Aways:**
- Learned how to use Java enums.
- Practiced using Java data structures such as stacks, arraylists, and maps.
